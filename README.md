# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview:

  The purpose of this analysis was to take 6 datasets (provided by HR) and create an organized database. Then, I used this database and some queries to find out the number of employees (and their titles and departments) who are eligible for retirement in the near future. After realizing there were many employees eligible for retirement, I created a list of qualified mentors in each department that could be assigned the task of training younger employees to replace these retirees.


Results:

  1) 50% of potential retirees are engineers [insert picture here]

  2) There are 1,549 potential mentors
  3) 748 of the potential mentors are engineers of some kind
  4) Of the 300,025 total employees, 90,398 are potential retirees (30.1%)
 
Summary:
  There are not enough potential mentors to mentor the needed replacement workforce. PH needs to look into hiring experienced help from outside of the company.
